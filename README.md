# Frontend Mentor - Article Preview Component Solution

This is my solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). This project helped me dive deep into responsive design patterns and JavaScript event handling.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- ✅ View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- ✅ See the social media share links when they click the share icon
- ✅ Experience different share behaviors on mobile vs desktop (mobile replaces content, desktop shows tooltip)
- ✅ Close the desktop share popup by clicking outside of it

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup** - Proper use of `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>` elements
- **CSS Grid** - For responsive layout structure
- **Flexbox** - For component alignment and spacing
- **CSS custom properties** - For consistent color theming
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, pure DOM manipulation
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Starting with mobile design, then scaling up
- **Event bubbling & propagation** - Event handling techniques

### Challenges Faced

1. **Desktop Popup Positioning** - Getting the tooltip arrow centered and positioned correctly with CSS `::before` pseudo-elements took some trial and error.

2. **State Management** - Managing different states (mobile active/inactive, desktop open/closed) across viewport changes required careful planning.
